I have been working on a project that requires a lot of analysis and planning. I enjoy the challenge of finding the best solution to a complex problem. I don’t like to waste time on trivial details or unnecessary social interactions. I prefer to work independently and focus on the big picture. I value logic, efficiency and competence above all else. I am confident in my abilities and opinions, but I am also open to constructive feedback and new perspectives. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and my work. I am not interested in conforming to the expectations or norms of others. I seek to understand the underlying principles and patterns of reality. I have high standards for myself and others, and I don’t tolerate mediocrity or incompetence.
